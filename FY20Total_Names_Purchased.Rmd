# Description


`r newthought('The purpose of this document')` is to summarise the FY20 Lead Names Purchased. 

* There were 3 search campaigns. 

* There were 4 actual search name purchase transactions. 

* We purchased SR, JR, and PH names from the College Board for which we have P.O. numbers.

* As part of the annual NRCCUA contract, which costs `$27,700.00`, we prepay for 45,000 names at `$0.47`, bringing the annual cost for search names to `$21,150.00`.

__Margin Figures__

Images and graphics play an integral role in Tufte's work. To place figures in the margin you can use the 

```{r fig-margin, fig.margin = TRUE, fig.cap = "MPG vs horsepower, colored by transmission.", fig.width=3.5, fig.height=3.5, cache=TRUE, message=FALSE}
colors <- c("#18288D", "#FFC13D")
mtcars2 <- mtcars
mtcars2$am <- factor(
  mtcars$am, labels = c('automatic', 'manual')
)
a_a <- ggplot(mtcars2, aes(hp, mpg, color = am)) +
  geom_point() + geom_smooth(se=FALSE ) +
  theme(legend.position = 'bottom') + theme_bw() +
    scale_color_manual(
        values=colors)
a_a
```



```{r}
imgur_image <-
   add_imgur_image(
     image = a_a,
     client_id = "851117406f0b457"
   )

```

The plot to the side will be included in an email.

The data he sent makes much more sense. \\
It was excluding students who are not yet captured \\
because the census report is a couple months away. We \\
discussed criteria for a new list which will hopefully \\ 
include students who have deposited and are due to start \\
in the upcoming months. This will give us a second year \\
of applications so we can look at the patterns of ap-\\
plication flow. He's sending the list by EOD tomorrow.
